            Jenn is an artist in jersey city (on purpose) and glitch community engineer at fog creek. my visual art has been described as "neon abstract pixel erotica" and my tech satire has been described as "your eyes are awful, like you are also awful." i am privileged to be able to express myself and work hard to help others do the same.
